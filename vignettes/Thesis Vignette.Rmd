The unique sectors were identified, and a table with relative weights of each was constructed, for the data on a monthly basis. The different sectors were S.T.Securities, Health.care, Industrials, Financials, Materials, Consumer.Discretionary, Information.Technology, Energy, Consumer.Staples, Utilities, Telecommunication.Services, Real.Estate, Cash.Derivatives, Telecommunications. The date is shown on the leftmost rows, followed by the different sectors. Each sector then has its relative weight with respect to the date in the corresponding row.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
